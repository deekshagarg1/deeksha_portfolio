<h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>
<br /><br />
<p>I am currently working as a MERN stack development intern at Zint Institute, where I am strengthening my skills in both frontend and backend technologies. This role has given me hands-on experience in building dynamic web applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I’ve actively contributed to developing and optimizing user interfaces using React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS, while implementing RESTful APIs for smooth data flow. Additionally, I’ve gained exposure to GitHub, which has improved my understanding of containerized development and deployment workflows.
<br /><br />
Throughout my internship, I’ve also worked on several personal and collaborative projects that showcase my capabilities as a full-stack developer. Some of my key projects include a rental website, an eCommerce platform, Acme Patient, a patient management system, SpoofCall, a call spoofing application, and a feature-rich ToDo website. These projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the MERN stack in real-world scenarios, from user authentication to CRUD operations and responsive UI design. These experiences have significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills and prepared me for advanced roles in web development.</p>
